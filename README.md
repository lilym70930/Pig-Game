# Pig-Game
Based on the game: Pass the Pig (party game) GAME RULES: The game has 2 players, playing in turns. In each turn, a player rolls the dice as many times as he wishes by pressing “ROLL DICE”. The results of the two dice together get added to her/his “CURRENT” score. However, if the player rolls a 1 on either of the dice then all his CURRENT score gets lost and it's the next player's turn (the moment you get 1, you won’t see it and it will immediately be the next player turn). The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his global score (the large score numbers in red font), and then it is the next players turn. The first player to reach 100 points (the default) on GLOBAL score wins the game. You can change the winning number by entering a number into the FINAL SCORE input. After the first round, you can play again by pressing the NEW GAME button.  **This project was built with JavaScript, HTML and CSS. **No need to install anything. HAVE FUN!!
